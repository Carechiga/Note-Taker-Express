## Description

In order to learn how to use express.j s and creat RESTful APIs, I have built this simple note taking application that stores and retrieces datafrom a json file.

The note taker allows a user to simply and effeciently manage information by giving a name to a note that can be retrieved to view its details. The notes can be deleted when the are no longer needed.
In order to create this application it required using express and its routing methods to manage the data in the app

## Installation

In order to run this app both express and uuid are required and can be installed by running "npm i"

## Usage

Once the app is being hosted click "Get Started" and this will take you to the note taking page. Exisiting notes will take up the left hand colum and their contents can be viewed by clicking on them. To add a new note the plus symbol on the left should be clicked which open a blank note that needs to be filled by the user. When the note title and the note content is input sufficeintly a save icon will appear in the top right hand corner and can be clicked to save the note. Notes can be deleted by clicking the trashcan icon next to the note title in the note list on the left hand side.
